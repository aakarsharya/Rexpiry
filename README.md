# Rexpiry
EngHack Project

### What it does
The app lets you take pictures of all your receipts and uploads the fresh foods as well as the expiry dates to a local database. If there are remaining items on the receipt they can be added manually and the expiry date is found automatically by clicking one button. Once food is nearing its expiry date the app sends a notification which tells the user which foods are expiring and in how long.
